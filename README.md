The following files are available:

  Lending Club - Loans by Purpose Scatter.R:  An r script that groups the 2014 loans by the borrower's purpose, and then   plots the percentage of these loans that were Charged Off (failed loans), and the average loan size.  The source code    will fetch and unzip the raw data from Lending Club's website and perform the processing to generate an image of the     plot
